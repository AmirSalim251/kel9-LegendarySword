Alex: Woohoo! Adventure time, baby!

Alex: Those monsters should tremble in fear at the doom I’m about to bring!

Magnus: …Are you out of your senses?

Freya: Let's not discourage him. We have a job to do.

Sword: …

(A rustle in the bushes interrupts their banter, and the group freezes as a werewolf emerges out of his hiding.)

Werewolf: RAWR!!

Everyone: AAAAAAAAAAAA!

Sword: (sighs) Alex, could you perhaps get everyone ready?

Alex: Huh? Oh, right! How?

Sword: (mutters) Truly hopeless... Freya, Magnus, stand by Alex. We're taking this thing down!

Freya, Magnus: (nods) Understood!

Sword: …And you too, Alex.

Alex: Yeah, yeah, I know what to do, okay?!

(In battle)

Freya: ...Hold on a moment. This species of wolves isn’t supposed to look like this. I should make a note of it for my research.

Magnus: Alas, I must concur. This... abomination appears most unpalatable. But in the face of scarcity, one must embrace the creed: waste not, want not.

Sword: OH, THESE LAZY DEVS!! 

Sword: Honestly, Magnus, Freya, stop overanalyzing and look at yourselves!
