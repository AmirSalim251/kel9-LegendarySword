Magnus: Why am I shaped like this? I can't even feel the ingredients in my pocket. Is this some cursed fate befallen upon me?

Freya: If they could create decent 2D sprites, why not invest in making us all in 3D? Such unreliable developers…

Sword: Hello, there's still a werewolf right in front of us. Back to battle, please.

(Battle)

(After the battle)

Alex: OH YEAH, I DID IT!

Sword: Indeed, you did. (sighs)

Magnus: Hey, let's not forget our contributions as well.

Freya: I never imagined a supposed hero could be this... naive.

Alex: Wait, not you too! Why do you guys keep ganging up on me...

Alex: Oh well, let's just keep moving forward...

Alex: ...but where exactly are we going?

(Sword smacks Alex on the head)

Alex: OUCH! What was that for?!

Sword: It's a spell to help you remember our path.

Alex: Ah, that's convenient. Thanks! I remember now, we're supposed to take a turn in a few meters...

Magnus: …I should be granted the privilege of being a 3D model.
