Alex(Happy): OH YEAH, I DID IT!

Sword(Normal): Indeed, you did. (sighs)

Magnus(Normal): Hey, let's not forget our contributions as well.

Freya(Angry): I never imagined a supposed hero could be this... naive.

Alex(Sad): Wait, not you too! Why do you guys keep ganging up on me...

Alex(Normal): Oh well, let's just keep moving forward...

Alex(Sad): ...but where exactly are we going?

(Sword smacks Alex on the head)

Alex(Sad): OUCH! What was that for?!

Sword(Serious): It's a spell to help you remember our path.

Alex(Happy): Ah, that's convenient. Thanks! I remember now, we're supposed to take a turn in a few meters...

Magnus(Angry): â€¦I should be granted the privilege of being a 3D model.
