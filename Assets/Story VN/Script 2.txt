Freya(Open): ...Hold on a moment. This species of wolves isn’t supposed to look like this. I should make a note of it for my research.

Magnus(Normal): Alas, I must concur. This... abomination appears most unpalatable. But in the face of scarcity, one must embrace the creed: waste not, want not.

Sword(CloseEyes): OH, THESE LAZY DEVS!! 

Sword(Serious): Honestly, Magnus, Freya, stop overanalyzing and look at yourselves!

Magnus(Angry): Why am I shaped like this? I can't even feel the ingredients in my pocket. Is this some cursed fate befallen upon me?

Freya(Angry): If they could create decent 2D sprites, why not invest in making us all in 3D? Such unreliable developers…

Sword(Surprised): Hello, there's still a werewolf right in front of us. Back to battle, please.
