Alex(Normal): Woohoo! Adventure time, baby!

Alex(Happy): Those monsters should tremble in fear at the doom I’m about to bring!

Magnus(Angry): …Are you out of your senses?

Freya(Open): Let's not discourage him. We have a job to do.

Sword(Serious): …

(A rustle in the bushes interrupts their banter, and the group freezes as a werewolf emerges out of his hiding.)

Werewolf(Normal): RAWR!!

(Everyone screams)

Sword(CloseEyes): (sighs) Alex, could you perhaps get everyone ready?

Alex(Sad): Huh? Oh, right! How?

Sword(Serious): (mutters) Truly hopeless... Freya, Magnus, stand by Alex. We're taking this thing down!

(Freya and Magnus nodded)

Sword(Serious): …And you too, Alex.

Alex(Normal): Yeah, yeah, I know what to do, okay?!
